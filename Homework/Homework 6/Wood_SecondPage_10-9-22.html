    <body> <h1><span id="background">This is where I will tell you things.</span></h1>
        <p><span id="background"> Class, at most moments I discern what is, with what I see. But I want to tell what I hear. A heated up computer, its fans rushing to mild the heat that this decade old computer can hold. The plastics are melted and the motherboard is sparking, hoping for death. There is a man at the front speaking in a tone, enthusiastic while almost let down. Taps of computers, masked with the whispers of flirts and humors.  	
            Why not tell the story of “the now”, that moment I am living it, like monks at a temple, silence of that moment, peace. I sit here in class, feeling the brass of my eyes, preparing my soul. I see all that are around me, on my right a man who is only ordinary in my perception. He seems like he works hard, fated to go through the major that he is in at this moment, no matter what is brought upon him, he will be content. In my constant periphery is a bleached blonde, Alaskan made, voice macho yet presentation is ambiguous, he has questions that need answered. All around them are “the boys”, some would say meat heads, or maybe the sport wranglers, maybe in a frat, or maybe just stuck in the middle of a life of strength and hidden plots of masculinity. These are the ones I will see for the rest of my life, the center of attention that they bring onto themselves, not receiving the deserved criticism. This is where we start. This is where we fight that starved animal; the eyes of judgment. 
                Fighting judgment, the eyes that seek me out, even my own go out of there way to dodge and weave through glares of interest. I feel it bare me, as everyone must feel as well, I don’t judge to demean anyone, I don't believe that I have the right to do so. Moments like this, the urge overflows the mind, tripping down the rabbit hole, and finding lonely judgment roar.    
                    People, they come up, three men in a row, gray clothes, distinctive, maybe that's too much to tell about three men. They have gruffed beards, funny little dainty hairs that speckle the face. They laugh at each other and their mannerisms declare that they are comfortable in this situation. They present a lot with being understood as “Stupid”, in their own words. As if giving off that information and having the lack of intelligence will make the blow lessened, or that to break the ice of an audience is to degrade yourself, nonetheless this is how people are. Talking from the writing that comes from the pages they wrote, it seemed so far from how they speak, so much clearer than how the dialogue that comes from the mouths that commune with each other.  They are smarter than they show, knowingly ignorant of what is around them. These are the men I watch in class; these are those men whom I don’t know what to think about. 
                Sitting here, studying those old long words. Stories strung out, an arc of a story, the setting is made and the characters are built; now for what they do. Is it not true, the thoughts in my head, the speculation of who? I mean, in no way to slander, but to tell the story of those I find intriguing.
            The middle man, the conjoining of the three, presented with a force, dull, full, an average essay teller. Still not a good presentation, but my interest in these folk has me on the edge of my seat, seeing what they had on the tip of their tongues. After another, he told the essay after my own, which was a quite nervous wreck, but his nicely juxtaposed mine with small wits of acknowledgment and the use of “stupid” which again, he was not. Latter, the only time I have ever felt like the words of another would lighten my globe, and deprive any other thoughts to rumble. 
             Many times before, even in the first moments of me knowing his existence, giving the confidence of a bull, strong, passionate, yet still lunged at the red flag I wouldn't dare think about coming near. Knowing this, I couldn't expect less from a wonderful presentation, unprepared and full of strong opinions about clarity. I could imagine what he would be like as he edged farther in life, a very opinionated old man; loud, unfiltered, and would grow a family with him being threshold. It is magnificent, he used the “ I know I am Stupid” argument, to continue his point of needed clarity, stomping me to the ground with the satisfaction in awe and humor, for that was his goal. I say that these people are not stupid, because they’re not. The reaction they receive, the act, It is bringing them more down to earth to the listener. Ringing my noggin with thoughts, he continued, and ended with something that will be with me forever. In context his speech of clarity in writing ends with the improved sentence “This is why we value diamonds and water; It’s clear.”  
            It made me think so much, yet it is so refutable. Everyone laughed at that final remark, finding solace in the humor of the phrase. I find it so intriguing, because we value water for its necessity, and ability to keep us alive. Diamonds, that is such a fine thing, it could be valued in clarity, yet history could tell us differently. Do we value clarity in any way other than its slight beauty, do we value it? Are we honest? Is a poem clear to the reader, bashed into our mind, its invasive tangles of letters. I don’t value it or otherwise I’d be bland.
            As he sat, the slight burst of laughter died, so I decided to start this paper here and now. I knew that I had to write a story, not clear and not valued like a diamond, no true climax, and no clear format. I could write you a story of the time that my dogs did silly things or that time that I embarrassed my whole family. I find that a post-modern idea on this very formal narrative essay is something I would choose. I knew that this wasn't my designed assignment, but what fun is the story I wrote out in middle school compared to the thoughts and reflections of the classroom, I ruminate on my own. Call this my falling action, the thesis; the meaning to each thought I go through, the clarity. Yet everything is altered, filtered through the crunchy white noise of the mind. My final statements.
            Go against the grain when shaving a diamond, breathe in the water and cough it out. When we all move on, this wont matter, other than the small lessons we take with us. Clarity and judgment, looking onto someone is never clear, we are always reflecting emotions, projections of jealousy. We are curious if we are better or worse than another, stupider than another, smarter even. When we write narratives in our heads it brings out funny Ideas, harsh criticisms and wonders of how others see. We are all prone to illusions and deception, not everyone is right, and nothing can be as clear. The cycles we go through the thoughts we have, opinions made by friends and family, what is taught to us in school. We all go through the motions, we all find our way to the end, and make new beginnings
